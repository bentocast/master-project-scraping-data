# My Master Project
Hi, this repo collects all my `python` scripts that I use to scrap the online data in each sections, and push the data to my local MSSQL database.

# Prerequisite 
MSSQL database is installed, and the schema is already created.

# How to run
Simple install the python dependency and then run the script.
```
# Install dependency
pip install requirements.txt

# Run the script
python src/main.py
```
